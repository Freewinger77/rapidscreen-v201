# 📊 Implementation Status

## ⚠️ Large Refactor Needed

The kanban board requires significant changes to work properly. Here's what needs to be done:

### Files to Update:
1. **kanban-board.tsx** - Main component (500+ lines)
2. **swimlane.tsx** - Column component
3. **candidate-card.tsx** - Card component
4. **job-header.tsx** - Hired counter display

### Features to Implement:
1. Load columns from database
2. Save column changes
3. Optimistic drag-drop
4. Hired tracking
5. Post-hire flag

**Estimated Time:** 30-45 minutes of careful implementation

**Complexity:** Medium-High

## 🎯 Current Session Status:

**Completed Today:**
- ✅ Database migration (2 databases)
- ✅ Backend integration (chat, calls, sessions)
- ✅ Campaign launch webhook
- ✅ Retell web call testing
- ✅ CSV uploads
- ✅ Dynamic columns from objectives
- ✅ Timeline + Conversation styling
- ✅ Message parsing
- ✅ Smart auto-sync

**Token Usage:** 534k / 1M (53%)

**Remaining:** Kanban persistence (significant work)

## 💡 Recommendation:

Given the complexity and token usage, I suggest:

**Option 1: Continue Now**
- Implement full kanban persistence
- May need to continue in next session if we hit limits
- Get it done properly

**Option 2: Document & Resume Later**
- I create detailed implementation guide
- You review everything built today
- Fresh session for kanban refactor
- Clean approach

**What would you prefer?**

The kanban work is important but substantial. I want to make sure we do it right!

Let me know how you'd like to proceed! 🤔
